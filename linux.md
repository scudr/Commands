# Linux commands

If you are in Ubuntu and want to create a shortcut to a directory you can use a feature in Linux called "symbolic link" or "symlink" for short:
```bash
 ln -s /mnt/c/XX/XXX/ ~/exercises
```
Make sure you are in the home directory and then:
```bash
cd ~/exercises
```

## VIM
```bash
vim file
```
To start typing, switch to Insert Mode by pressing *i* and *ESC* to go back to Normal Mode

- *ESC* & *:W* to save changes 
- *ESC* & *:Wq* to save and quit 

to search on vim */*  and delete the searched word *dw*
