Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance to spread the load and to decrease the response time.

Sharding is often used in large, high-traffic applications where there's a significant amount of data to be managed, and is especially common in NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

A shard key is a data item that is used to determine where a particular piece of data will be stored. This could be something like a customer ID, an email address, or a geographic location. When a request comes into the system, the shard key is used to figure out which shard the data should be stored in or retrieved from.

For example, imagine you're storing customer data and you're using the customer's ID as the shard key. If you're using a simple range-based sharding strategy, you might decide that customers with IDs from 1 to 1000 are stored on Server A, customers with IDs from 1001 to 2000 are stored on Server B, and so on. When a request comes in to retrieve data for a customer with ID 1500, the system would know to direct that request to Server B.

The actual sharding function can be a simple range-based function like the one described above, or it could be something more complex, like a consistent hashing function, which can distribute data more evenly across the servers and is more flexible when shards are added or removed.

 a shard usually refers to a horizontal portion of data in a database. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance, which could be on a different machine. The collection of all shards makes up the entire database.

So, you can think of a shard as a subset of your overall data, stored in a separate database on a server. This allows the data and load to be spread across multiple servers, reducing the load on any one server and improving performance.

For example, if you have a database of customers and decide to shard the data based on the customers' geographic location, one shard may contain data for customers in North America and be stored on one server, another shard may contain data for customers in Europe and be stored on a different server, and so on.

Therefore, while a shard is stored on a data server, the term "shard" refers to the portion of data rather than the server itself.
